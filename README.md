# Gitma Introduction Notebook

The jupyter notebook in the Repository gives an introduction to processing and analysing your annotations from the annotation platform [CATMA](https://catma.de/) with the python package GitMA. For further information on GitMA see its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/forTEXT/gitma) and the [documentation](https://gitma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Usage

## Local

To run the notebook locally, clone the rpository with ```git clone https://github.com/janis711/gitma_introuction.git```and install GitMA with ```pip install git+https://github.com/forTEXT/gitma```. If you have Jupyter installed, you can now open the notebook in your preferred environment.

## Binder

To run the notebook without installing anything locally, you can launch it directly in your browser via Binder:

This will create a temporary Jupyter environment with all required dependencies preinstalled, including GitMA.
